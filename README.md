# Airacle

Airacle is a system developed and engineered at ITESM Campus Toluca by Industrial Designers and Architects. Mentored by a bunch of professors this repository shows the very last advance in project's control and code features.

With 5 funcionalities, web reporting (please don't send false requests), and lighting system, this will become the next air cleanser you will ever need.

To check out the code please mind that is divided in two:

1. Airacle: core measuring and controlling functions (humidifier, ventilator and neopixel lights)
2. Airacle Network: nodemcu code to communicate arduino controller with the webserver


Expect the schematics and real site soon.
